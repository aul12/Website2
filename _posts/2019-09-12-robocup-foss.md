While i was still at school i participated at [RoboCup-Junior](https://junior.robocup.org/rcj-soccer-open/), most of the years in the soccer open discipline. 
Our team "Bodenseehaie" (sharks of lake constance) participated at the world cup four times from 2013 to 2016 and even won in 2016. 

#TODO More rcj

Its my firm believe that all research should be freely available ([free as in freedom, not as in free beer](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)) to the public for the greater good.
Thus i made a decision which was long overdue: to release all our software as free software (licensed under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html)). 
This not only includes our main code, but also our simulator, a desktop program for debugging and an algorithm to detect the orange ball.
