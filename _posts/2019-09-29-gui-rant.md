This is a rant. 
In 1984 Apple released the Macintosh, the first widely available computer that featured a graphical user interface [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface#Popularization), this was 35 years ago. 
35 years in which developers had the opportunity to implement GUI-Frameworks and Libraries, which will make it easy to develop applications with GUIs.
And here we are, it is 2019, and this is still not the case.

At first i want to clarify some points and lay my criteria for a good GUI framework out. 
I primarily develop applications using C++, thus my focus will be on the C++ ecosystem, nevertheless this applies for other languages as well.
