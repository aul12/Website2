I²C is a protocol which defines a bus used for the communication
between multiple integrated circuits, such as processors and sensors. In
this context a bus refers to a connection between multiple entitys using
only one shared communication channel.

The devices connected to an I²C bus are differentiated by their type:
either master or slave. Only master devices are allowed to start a
transaction on the bus, during such a transaction they either write to a
slave device or read from a slave by requesting data. Typically
processors are master devices and sensors slave devices. A device is
identified by an 7-bit number which is called the address, thus there
can be a maximum of $$2^7 -1 = 127$$ devices on a single bus (the address
0 is reserved for broadcast messages).

For the actual transmission of data I²C relies on a serial
communication scheme, this means that the data is transmitted bit after
bit over the connection, the contrary principle would be parallel
communication where multiple bits are transfered at once using multiple
data lines. The single data line of I²C is typically called SDA
(**S**erial **Da**ta). Additionally there is a second line, on which a
clock signal is transmitted synchronous to the data. This second line
provides a synchronization between the devices. The clock line is
typically called SCL (**S**erial **Cl**ock).

## The Protocol

Nearly all application are using a single master. Thus this explanation is limited to single bus
systems, this removes the challenges that occur when multiple masters
try to access the bus at the same time.

To signal events during transaction special signals are used. The next
section explains how the signals are represented as actual electronic
signals in hardware, for now we will just have a look at the protocol.
The required signals are:

*  **Start**: Is emitted by the master to signal the beginning of a new
   transaction
*  **Stop**: Is emitted by the master to signal the end of a
   transaction
*  **Repeated Start**: A start when no stop has been sent before, is
   used when the transaction mode (read or write) changes
*  **Acknowledge (ACK)**: Is sent by the receiving device to signal
   that data has been received and the device is ready to receive more
   data
*  **Not-Acknowledge (NACK)**: Is sent by the receiving device to
   signal that data has been received but the device does not want to
   receive more data

### Write Transaction

A write transaction begins with the master writing Start onto the bus.
This results in all slaves waiting for the following address byte. This
is next address byte consists of the 7 address bits (in the upper 7
bit), and a read/write (R/W) bit as the 0-th bit (see table below). 
If the R/W bit is 0 the master wants to
write data, if it is 1 it wants to read data from the slave.


Structure of the address byte, Addr-Bit-N marks the N-th bit of
the address, with $$N=0$$ being the least significant:

| Bit | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| --- |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Content | Addr-Bit 6 | | |... | | | Addr-Bit 0 | R/W |


As a response to the address byte the slave with the matching address
replies with an ACK signal. Now the master can start writing data to the
slave, for this the data is written byte by byte, between each byte the
master is waiting for the confirmation in form of an ACK signal by the
slave.

At the end of the transaction the master sends a Stop signal. This makes
the bus available for other transactions.

### Read Transaction

A read transaction starts with a write sequence similar to how the write
transaction starts. This counterintuitive behaviour is necessary as the
slave needs to know which data the master wants to read.

In more detail the initial request phase consists of (see above for more
details): the start signal, the address byte with the R/W bit set to 0
(write), and the data which specifies which data the master wants to
read. In contrast to the write transaction there is no stop signal at
the end. Instead the master transmits another start signal, which is
often called a repeated start. This repeated start is followed by an
address byte, like it was the case at the first Start, but this time the
R/W bit is set to 1 to read data.

Like above the slave with the matching address confirms the address byte
with an ACK. This ACK of the slave is followed by an ACK of the master
to request the first data byte.

As long as the master confirms the received data byte with an ACK
message the slave sends more data bytes. If the master is finished
receiving data it sends an NACK message to signal the slave that the
transmission is finished. This NACK message is then followed by Stop
signal from the master to signal the end of the transaction and release
the bus.

### Virtual Registers

The above protocol specifies how a master and multiple slaves can
exchange data over a shared bus. What is not specified by the protocol
is how the data that is sent is to be interpreted by the instances (so
to speak the application layer protocol). For this there is no uniform
standard but many devices base their communication on the principle of
virtual registers.

A register is memory cell of fixed size, for I²C 8-bit is mostly used,
as this is the size used for communication. Virtual in this context
refers to the fact that the slave does not expose it's actual registers
to the master but only provides an interface which behaves like a
register.

Every register is identified by it's address, which is an 8-bit number.
The register map, that is the interpretation of the data in the
registers, is different for every sensors but can be found in the
datasheet of the respective sensors. Additionally the register map also
specifies if a register can be read from and written to or only read
from, for example a register containing the sensor data is most probably
read-only as the sensor data is only written by the sensors itself and can not
be written by the user.

Excerpt of the register map of an environment sensor (CCS811):

| Address  |Name        |R/W  |Size     |Description |
| ---------|------------|-----|---------|------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0        |STATUS      |R    |1 byte   |Status register |
| 1        |MEAS\_MODE  |R/W  |1 byte   |Measurement mode and conditions register |
| ...      |            |     |         | |
| 3        |RAW\_DATA   |R    |2 bytes  |Raw ADC data values for resistance and current source used. |
| ...      |            |     |         | |
| 32       |HW\_ID      |R    |1 byte   |Hardware ID. The value is 0x81 |

Using this principle of virtual registers the protocol can be refined.
For a write transaction the first data byte is the address of the
register in which the master wants to write. The next byte is the actual
data which should be written into the register. If the master sends more
data these values are usually written into the subsequent registers. So
if data should be written into successive registers it is sufficient to
send the address of the first register and then continue with writing
all data.

For a read transaction the master starts by writing a single byte, the
address of the register that the master wants to read. After the
repeated start the master can then read the register. Similar to the
behaviour when writing it is also possible to continue reading data,
this will read the next registers.

Most I²C slaves implement the virtual register principle like
explained above, but it is important to remember that this behaviour is
not part of the protocol and depends entirely on the manufacturer of the
I²C slave. It is always necessary to consult the datasheet before
implementing a library.

## Physical Layer

### Electrical Properties

The I²C bus consists of two data lines: SDA and SCL. Additionally, to
have well defined voltage levels, all devices need to be connected to
the same ground reference.

All signals are binary this means they are either set to ground
(0V) or $$V_\text{CC}$$. Common values for $$V_\text{CC}$$ are
5V and 3.3V, depending on the devices connected to the
bus. The two voltage levels are also often refered to as
*high* and *low*.

Like explained above all devices are connected to both the SDA and
the SCL line. In a naive implementation the device that is currently
active would pull the data lines either *high* or *low* depending on the
desired state. This implementation has a major drawback: if more than
one device is active at a time, this can be the case when the active
device changes or if there is an error with one of the devices, there
can be a short circuit. Assume that a slave is too fast and tries to
respond before the master has finished sending data, in this case the
slave tries to set the data lines to one voltage and the master to the
other (see figure below).

![Naive implementation](../../../../../assets/img/i2c/short-circuit.svg){:class="img-responsive" width="100%"}

I²C solves this problem by allowing devices only to pull the data
lines *low* and not *high*. If the device wants to have a *high* level
on one data lines it needs to set the output pin to high impedance and
an external pull up resistor will pull the data line up (see figure below). Typical values for the pull up resistors
are 1k, 4.7k or 10k depending on the desired clock speed.

![Pull-Up Resistors](../../../../../assets/img/i2c/pull-up.svg){:class="img-responsive" width="100%"}

The clock is always generated by the master, even when a slave is
writing data via SDA. If a slave requires more time for writing data it
too can pull down SCL, this is refered to as clock stretching and will
effectively result in a lower SCL frequency.

### Data Transmission

A single bit is transfered in every clock cycle, staring with most
significant bit of the byte. When SCL is *low* the transmitter writtes
SDA, when SCL becomes *high* the receiver can read the bit. During the
SCL *high* time the transmitter must ensure that SDA does not change,
this behaviour is depicted in the figure below:

![Data transmission](../../../../../assets/img/i2c/transmission.svg){:class="img-responsive" width="100%"}

### Signals

#### Start

A start signal is sent by the master by pulling SDA to low while SCL is
high (see figure below).

![Start signal](../../../../../assets/img/i2c/start.svg){:class="img-responsive" width="100%"}

#### Stop

A stop signal is sent by the master by pulling SDA to high while SCL is
high (see figure below).

![Stop signal](../../../../../assets/img/i2c/stop.svg){:class="img-responsive" width="100%"}

#### Acknowledge and Not-Acknowledge

The receiver acknowledges the received byte by pulling SDA to *low*
during the ninth clock cycle, the timing is the same as if the receiver
would send a ninth bit 

A not acknowledge is sent by the
receiver by not pulling SDA *low*, thus SDA is *high*.
