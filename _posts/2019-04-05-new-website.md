As you might have guessed after visiting this site i have a completly new website! After i had more or less abandonded my old website (i still believe the concept is really cool, so it still is available at [aul12.me/old](http://aul12.me/old)) i tried to develop a new website from scratch but pretty soon realized i'm not a designer. So in the third iteration i started using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site generator.

#### My old website:
