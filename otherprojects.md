# Carolo Cup
I participated for two years at the [Carolo-Cup](https://wiki.ifr.ing.tu-bs.de/carolocup/en/carolo-cup) with Team "Spatzenhirn".
We scored the third place in 2018 and won the Cup in 2019.
In the team i developed the road-marking detection, the sign detection and the obstacle detection for use in the vehicle. I 
am also responsible for the software structure and the computer infrastructure.

# SerialToolbox
During the initial phase of software development for a microcontroller i often feel the need to view data which the microcontroller sends via UART to a computer. 
This is why i developed SerialToolbox, to not only be able to send and receive data but also to do this using a multitude of different representations.
SerialToolbox is inspired by the program HTerm (which was sadly discontinued in 2008). It is written in modern C++17 using QT, the software is completly 
opensource (Licensed under GPLv3) and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aul12/SerialToolbox).
